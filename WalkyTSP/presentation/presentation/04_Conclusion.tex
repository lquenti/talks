  \begin{block}{Exact Solver: Dynamic Load Distribution}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Pruning makes the actual work load unpredictable
      \item Instead of dividing chunks, the coordinator gives out work dynamically
      \item Pro: More equal work distribution
      \item Contra: More communication
    \end{itemize}
  \end{block}
  \pause
  \begin{block}{More MPI analysis and performance tuning}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Especially using Vampir
    \end{itemize}

  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Developed a CLI tool compatible with TSPLIB
      \pause
    \item Provided a software that is
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Blazingly fast
        \item Pure Rust (compatible with C-based MPI flavours)
        \item Supports shared- and distributed memory parallelization
        \item Well documented and thoroughly tested
      \end{itemize}
      \pause
    \item Including an exact solver
      \begin{itemize}
        \item With several pruning-based optimizations
        \item Both shared- and distributed memory parallelized
      \end{itemize}
      \pause
    \item And multiple approximate solvers
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Including the easy to parallelize "Nearest Neighbour" method
        \item Supporting the sophisticated "Christofides" algorithm
        \item Both shared- and distributed memory parallelized
      \end{itemize}
      \pause
    \item Implemented the 1-tree lower bound
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Utilized shared- and distributed memory parallelization
      \end{itemize}
  \end{enumerate}
